    # Server-Sent Events: Build a Chat App with Streaming Response

    ## Introduction: What are Server-Sent Events (SSE)?
    
    Imagine if a web page could subscribe to data from the server, all it had to do was establish connection to a certain endpoint, any updates from the server would be received via the connecton and the client could handle accordingly.
    
    This is what [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) allows, A client-server connection where the server can send data (Events) to the client whenever the server wants to. This is in contrast to the regular client-server connections wherein the client has to send data first to recieve data from the server.

    ## Components of the app
    
    1. A Server that has capability to sent `text/event-stream` response
    2. A Vanilla Js client that will use the native EventSource API to 1. Establish the SSE Connection & 2. Handle incomming messages

    Let's build

    ### The Server:

    For the Server, we'll need a simple API server that has the capability to send text/event-stream response. For this demo, we'll be [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation). While FastAPI doesn't have any built-ins for streaming response, the server it's based on: starlette does, so we'll also need [sse_starlette](https://github.com/sysid/sse-starlette).

    ```python
    app.py

    import asyncio
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi.responses import Response
    from sse_starlette import EventSourceResponse, ServerSentEvent

    app = FastAPI()

    # A global variable to store the client message that'll be 
    # streamed back
    streamable_str = ""

    # The async generator that loops through each character in the client
    # message (streamable_str) and yeilds each character. The last
    # character is yeilded with a custom event: "end" which can help
    # us track the stream on the client
    async def mock_async_generator():
        global streamable_str
        end = len(streamable_str)
        for idx, c in enumerate(streamable_str):
            if idx == end - 1:
                yield ServerSentEvent(data=c, event="end")
                break
            yield ServerSentEvent(data=c, event="message")
            await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
        streamable_str = ""

    # The SSE endpoint
    @app.get("/stream")
    def get_stream():
        if streamable_str:
            return EventSourceResponse(content=mock_async_generator())
        return EventSourceResponse(content=iter(()))


    # The endpoint to recieve message from client
    @app.post("/stream")
    def post_user_message(payload: UserMessage):
        global streamable_str
        streamable_str = payload.message + " "
        return Response("success")
    ```
