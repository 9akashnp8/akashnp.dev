# Introduction

* The Redux Toolkit package is **intended to be the standard** way to write Redux logic
+ Helps **solve problems** like standard Redux **requiring complicated configuration, too much boilerplate etc**
- Therefore Redux Toolkit was created: **opinionated, batteries-included toolset** for efficient Redux development
- Comes along with **"RTK-Query", a data fetching library** which nicely integrates with Redux and has many **features like caching, interceptors etc**.
